# Knowledge Graph Demo

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook that demonstrates how to create and visualize a knowledge graph using Python libraries such as pandas, networkx, and matplotlib.

## Requirements

To run the notebook, you need to have the following Python libraries installed:

- pandas
- networkx
- matplotlib

You can install the required libraries using the following command:

```sh
pip install pandas networkx matplotlib
```
Alternatively, if you are using Poetry, you can install the dependencies by running:

```sh
poetry install
```

## Notebook Contents
The notebook kg_demo.ipynb contains the following sections:

1) **Import Required Libraries**: Import the necessary libraries, including pandas, networkx, and matplotlib.
2) **Load Data**: Load the IT-related data into a pandas DataFrame.
3) **Create Knowledge Graph**: Use NetworkX to create a knowledge graph from the loaded data.
4) **Visualize Knowledge Graph**: Use matplotlib to visualize the knowledge graph.
5) **Query Knowledge Graph**: Demonstrate how to query the knowledge graph to extract useful information.

## Running the Notebook
